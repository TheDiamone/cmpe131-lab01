Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent?

Reflection: The power of branching is essential for collaboration because it provides isolated environments where developers can build and test features without compromising on the stability of the main codebase. The isolation allows for a parallel workflow, enabling a team to work on multiple tasks at the same time without "breaking the build" for others.

This strategy prevents "iteration hell" by avoiding constant conflicts in a single shared line of code. It acts as a safety gate, preventing untested regressions of accidental overwrites from reaching production. By utilizing pull request , teams can conduct through code reviews and automated testing on contained changes, ensuring only high quality, verified code is integrated into the final project.
