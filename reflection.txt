Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent? Using branches is a powerful and safe way to work with a team of software engineers to collaborate on a single project because it give options to fix bugs and make sure that everyone is being tracked on their work. Just in case someone introduces a bug into the main branch you can see who made the merge and where to fix it and how back to go back in a branch. The biggest problem it prevents is keeping the main branch safe.
